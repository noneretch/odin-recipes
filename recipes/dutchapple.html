<h3>Grandma Connie's Dutch Apple Pancake</h3>

<p>
Ooohhhh the sweet, savory, deliciousness of apples, butter, cinnamon, and cast iron. A flavorful combination to transport you back to your poor dutch roots. Remember, it's not the sum of the ingredients that matter, but rather, the mathematical proof, showing that it's possible to be done in the first place. Just remember - the amount of butter <em>suggested</em> in the recipe is simply a <strong>lower-limit</strong>. Go wildcats!

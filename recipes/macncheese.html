<h3>Suzie Q's World Famous Macca</h3>

<p>Is there a more comforting and timeless dish than Mac n' Cheese? It's <em>tried and true</em>. It doesn't take shit from anyone. It could whoop your ass in a fight and floss its teeth with your skinny ass. And yet it doesn't, because it knows that all that is keeping this unordered world from collapsing inward, is the faith we have in our most cherished dishes.</p>

<p>This recipe comes from my mother of 25 years. Where she got it from, is a mystery. As tight-lipped as she is female, we may never know. I remember many a day in my adolescence, returning home from the <strong>coal mine</strong>, stained black from soot and tired to the boner, jonesing for a BnB and meat pie, only to find hot, steaming, sultry, macaroni and cheese sitting by the fire. While some may turn up their nose at such a <em>basic</em> meal, the warmth, comfort, and - dare I say - abject sexiness of this dish, are enough to make even the most hardened of child-miners say <strong>Ba-Ba-Booey</strong>! </p>
